        <p>Causality is a fundamental concept in many scientific fields,
        including economics, epidemiology, and social sciences. It
        allows us to understand how one variable influences another.
        With this understanding, we can know how to act or intervene to
        achieve desired outcomes.</p>
        <p>As Hume (1748) noted:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The only immediate utility of all the sciences is to teach us
        how to control and regulate future events through their
        causes.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>For example, we might want to understand how educational
        attainment affects income levels, or how a new drug influences
        health outcomes.</p>
        <p>This post introduces the <strong>potential outcomes
        framework</strong>, which provides a unified language for causal
        inference.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Then, we will use the
        notation of potential outcomes to define causal effects.</p>
        <h2 id="a-motivating-example">A Motivating Example</h2>
        <p>Consider a motivating example where we want to understand the
        effect of a certain job training program on individuals’ income.
        We want to know how much more income an individual would earn if
        they participated in the program compared to if they did not. We
        denote the income of individual <span
        class="math inline">\(i\)</span> as <span
        class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>, and whether individual <span
        class="math inline">\(i\)</span> participated in the job
        training program as <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span>,
        and we observe the pair <span class="math inline">\((Y_i,
        D_i)\)</span> for each individual <span
        class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in our sample.</p>
        <h2 id="the-potential-outcomes-framework">The Potential Outcomes
        Framework</h2>
        <h3 id="potential-outcomes-notation">Potential Outcomes
        Notation</h3>
        <p>The primitive concept in the potential outcomes framework is
        that there is a treatment (or manipulation, intervention) that
        can be applied to a unit (e.g., an individual, a household, or a
        firm at a particular time). The treatment can be binary (e.g.,
        treated or untreated) or continuous (e.g., the dosage of a
        drug). For simplicity, we will focus on binary actions in this
        post.</p>
        <p>As shown in the <em>Science Table</em> below, the potential
        outcomes framework posits that for each unit <span
        class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, there are two potential
        outcomes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><span class="math inline">\(Y_i(1)\)</span>, the income
        that unit <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> would have been
        observed under the hypothetical intervention <span
        class="math inline">\(D_i = 1\)</span>, and</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="math inline">\(Y_i(0)\)</span>, the income
        that unit <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> would have been
        observed under the hypothetical intervention <span
        class="math inline">\(D_i = 0\)</span>.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These potential outcomes are often referred to as
        <strong>counterfactuals</strong> because they represent what
        would have happened under different circumstances.</p>

        </table>
        <p>Notice that each potential outcomes is <em>a priori</em>
        observable, meaning that we can imagine a world where we could
        observe both potential outcomes for each unit. For example, if
        we had a parallel universe where individual <span
        class="math inline">\(i\)</span> participated in the job
        training program, we would observe <span
        class="math inline">\(Y_i(1)\)</span>, and in another universe
        where individual <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> did not
        participate, we would observe <span
        class="math inline">\(Y_i(0)\)</span>.</p>
        <p>However, <em>a posteriori</em>, after the treatment is
        applied, we can only observe the outcome that corresponds to the
        treatment status of the unit. This is also known as the
        <strong>fundamental problem of causal inference</strong>. In our
        example, if individual <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
        participates in the job training program, we observe <span
        class="math inline">\(Y_i(1)\)</span>, and if they do not
        participate, we observe <span
        class="math inline">\(Y_i(0)\)</span>. The observed outcome
        <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>, therefore, is related
        to the potential outcomes as follows: <span
        class="math display">\[
        Y_i = D_i Y_i(1) + (1 - D_i) Y_i(0), \tag{1}
        \]</span> or equivalently, <span class="math display">\[
        Y_i = Y_i(D_i), \tag{2}
        \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Y_i(D_i)\)</span> is
        the observed outcome for unit <span
        class="math inline">\(i\)</span> given their natural treatment
        value <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span>.</p>
        <h3 id="stable-unit-treatment-value-assumption-sutva">Stable
        Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)</h3>
        <p>While it seems straightforward to write the potential
        outcomes as <span class="math inline">\(Y_i(1)\)</span> and
        <span class="math inline">\(Y_i(0)\)</span> and relate them to
        the observed outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>
        through Equation 1, we are implicitly making two important
        assumptions, together known as the <strong>stable unit treatment
        value assumption (SUTVA)</strong>:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p>(no interference) the potential outcomes for each unit
        are not affected by the treatment status of other units,
        and</p></li>
        <li><p>(no hidden variations) there are no hidden variations in
        the treatment that would lead to different potential outcomes
        for the same treatment status.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Let’s dive deeper into these two assumptions.</p>
        <h4 id="no-interference-assumption">No Interference
        Assumption</h4>
        <p>When we write the potential outcomes as <span
        class="math inline">\(Y_i(1)\)</span> and <span
        class="math inline">\(Y_i(0)\)</span>, we are implicitly
        assuming that the potential outcomes for each unit are not
        affected by the treatment status of other units.</p>
        <p>In our example, this means that the income of individual
        <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is not influenced by
        whether other individuals participated in the job training
        program.</p>
        <p>This assumption can be violated in many real-world scenarios.
        For example, if the job training program creates a spillover
        effect, where the program not only affects the treated
        individuals but also influences the income of untreated
        individuals because the treated individuals share their
        knowledge or skills with others, then the potential outcomes for
        each unit would depend on the treatment status of other units.
        In such cases, it would be better to account for these spillover
        effects using a more flexible notation.</p>
        <h4 id="no-hidden-variations-assumption">No Hidden Variations
        Assumption</h4>
        <p>Another implicit assumption typically made in the potential
        outcomes framework is that there are no hidden variations in the
        treatment that would lead to different potential outcomes for
        the same treatment status.</p>
        <p>For example, if the job training program has different
        versions or levels of intensity (e.g., online vs. in-person
        training, or short-term vs. long-term training), then the
        potential outcomes for each unit would depend on the specific
        version of the treatment they received. In the presence of such
        variations, we would need to specify the treatment more
        precisely.</p>
        <h2 id="defining-causal-effects">Defining Causal Effects</h2>
        <p>Once we have defined the potential outcomes, we can use them
        to define causal effects, which are functions of the Science
        Table above.</p>
        <p>For example, the <strong>individual causal effect</strong> of
        the job training program on unit <span
        class="math inline">\(i\)</span> can be defined as the
        difference between the two potential outcomes: <span
        class="math display">\[
        \tau_i \equiv Y_i(1) - Y_i(0).
        \]</span> This individual causal effect <span
        class="math inline">\(\tau_i\)</span> represents the change in
        income for unit <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> if they
        were to participate in the job training program compared to if
        they did not. Due to the fundamental problem of causal
        inference, we can only observe either <span
        class="math inline">\(Y_i(1)\)</span> or <span
        class="math inline">\(Y_i(0)\)</span> for each unit <span
        class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, but not both. Therefore, this
        quantity cannot be recovered from the data without very strong
        homogeneity assumptions.</p>
        <p>Instead, we are often interested in the <strong>average
        causal effect</strong> (ACE), also known as the <strong>average
        treatment effect</strong> (ATE), of the job training program on
        the income of all units can be defined as the average of the
        individual causal effects: <span class="math display">\[
        \tau \equiv \operatorname{E}(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)) =
        \operatorname{E}(Y_i(1)) - \operatorname{E}(Y_i(0)),
        \]</span> where the expectation is taken over the distribution
        of the units in the sample.</p>
        <p>Another common quantity of interest is the <strong>average
        treatment effect on the treated</strong> (ATT), which is defined
        as the average of the individual causal effects for the treated
        units: <span class="math display">\[
        \begin{align*}
        \tau_{\text{ATT}}
        &amp;\equiv \operatorname{E}(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) \mid D_i = 1) \\
        &amp;= \operatorname{E}(Y_i(1) \mid D_i = 1) -
        \operatorname{E}(Y_i(0) \mid D_i = 1).
        \end{align*}
        \]</span></p>
